Issues:
1) Can't get correct letters to display properly in hangman area.

a) The letters display in order typed, but after the underscores(game.js, specifically line 83)
b) The correct letter displays once, with nothing following it.
c) The letters display after the underscors in apparently the correct order (in the testing files, the letter is set).
d) The letter displays only once with a single underscore following it.
e) The letter displays only once with several underscores following it.
f) The letter displays only once after several underscores and with one following it.
g) The letter displays twice, right next to eachother, followed by several underscores.

What I have tried:
a) blanks = blanks + hidden[i] + " "; //This is line 83 from game.js
b) blanks = word[i] + " "; (With or without the " ";)
c) blanks = blanks + word[i]; //Currenly how the testing javascript is.
d) blanks[i] = letter; blanks[i] = letter + " "; blanks += letter;
e) blanks[i] = letter + blanks;
f) blanks[i] += letter;
g) blanks = word[i] + blanks;
h) Creating a new array with the indeices of the letter pushed into it and doing this: blanks[spot] = word[i]
i) Looking for other js hangman games to see I) if I can see their code II) if they are using just js III) if I can follow their logic. 
i) Researching different ways of replacing parts of strings, though it appears they'll end up replacing the whole array of underscores.
j) Trying to find a way to replace part of an array with the corresponding part of an array or string that will work with a variable. This generally ends up with one of the listed or the wrong letter displayed.

What I want:
Help. At minimum, getting pointed in the right direction. More realistically, an idea of what I might need to scrap or alter to get this working.

What I DO NOT want:
You to code it for me. (I'm lost, but I CAN get there.)

2) The reset button

a) I know it's a function.
b) I know the variables it needs to reset.
c) It looks like it need to be outside of the on.click function.
d) One of the ones I had pulled a new word, but didn't clear the display.
e) Another gave me an undefined error.
f) And the last ate my play area.
g) I've hit google and most of the sources I've found use jQuery or are for a form, same with js hangman games where I can see the code.
h) I've tried Stack Overflow, youTube, a public github repo that's doing the same project, webdeveloper.com, www.dummies.com, w3schools.com, HTML5 Game Devs Forum, JSFiddle, Khan Academy, and CSS Tricks (nothing there).

What I want:
A clearer explination. No, seriously. I'm not sure how you can call it intially if you put it around the variable that need to reset. I keep getting undefined errors and I need to leave for work soon.

What I DO NOT want:
Again, don't code it for me. I'm confused, but I NEED to do this on my own.
